This week, I focused on learning Next.JS. Fortunately, I found a tutorials for the framework on their website! I spent my week following the tutorial step by step to make the website you see now. It has gotten me really familiar
with Next.js, along with some JS at the beginning. The following lesson is trying to convert this blog into typescript, so I will do that either this upcoming week or the following week. I'm not certain because I have a very busy week coming up, and I don't think I will be able to make meaningful progress next week.
